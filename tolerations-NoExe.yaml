# In this example, the pod has a toleration for the "gpu=true" taint with "NoExecute" effect. 
# This means the pod can be scheduled on nodes with the taint "gpu=true:NoExecute". 
# The Pods which are existing in this nodes with the taint "gpu=true:NoExecute" must have a toleration.
# If the pods which are exiting in this nodes with  doesn't have the taint "gpu=true:NoExecute",
# it will evict those pods.
# if this pod is running and a matching taint is added to the node, then the pod will stay bound 
# to the node for 3600 seconds, and then be evicted. If the taint is removed before that time,
# the pod will not be evicted.
