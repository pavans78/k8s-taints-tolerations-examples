# PreferNoSchedule is a "preference" or "soft" version of NoSchedule. The control plane will
# try to avoid placing a Pod that does not tolerate the taint on the node, but it is not guaranteed.
# In this example, the pod has a toleration for the "gpu" taint with "PreferNoSchedule" effect. 
# This means the pod can be scheduled on nodes with the taint "gpu=true:PreferNoSchedule," 
# sometimes even if conditon fails it will schedules into the nodes with the taint "gpu=true:PreferNoSchedule.
